//pull the country list from the api ->
//map through that so that when a button is clicked, every country will display with a link

//each one of those links should bring up information about the country - bringing the carbon emissions associated with the following:
//coal
//gas
//geothermal
//hydro
//nuclear
//petroleum
//solar photovoltaic
//Wind
//will have to use state to grab the name of the region and plug it into the fetch request (should there be a component for each type of electricity generation?)

//questions for Jay:
//mapping through countries list - use Link to generate a link for each?
//how to manipulate fetch POST request with state

//stretch goal - render a graph on each countries page
//there will also be a search bar that will transport the user to the correct page
//give the user the option to choose two different countries and show their data side by side
//highlight comparison between countries through color, or other differentiation

//styling


//Thursday: 
//readme
//deployment
//write to API
